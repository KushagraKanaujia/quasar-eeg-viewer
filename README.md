# QUASAR EEG/ECG Viewer - Coding Assignment Submission

## Assignment Requirements Met ✅

This solution addresses all core requirements for the QUASAR coding assignment:

- ✅ **CSV Data Loading**: Supports QUASAR format with metadata parsing
- ✅ **Interactive EEG/ECG Plotting**: Web-based visualization with Plotly
- ✅ **Dual-Axis Scaling**: EEG in µV, ECG in mV with proper scaling
- ✅ **Time Navigation**: Scrolling and zooming through signal data
- ✅ **Channel Selection**: Toggle individual EEG/ECG channel visibility
- ✅ **Professional Interface**: Clean, responsive web-based GUI

## Design Rationale

**Web-Based Approach**: This solution uses a modern web framework (Dash/Plotly) to deliver the required visualization functionality. This design choice offers several advantages:

- **Rapid Development**: Interactive features implemented efficiently using proven libraries
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any system with a web browser
- **Professional UI**: Modern interface with minimal custom CSS required
- **Future Extensibility**: Easy to add features like real-time streaming or collaboration

The core functionality remains exactly as specified - this is simply a delivery mechanism that showcases full-stack capabilities while meeting all technical requirements.

## Time Investment

**Development Time**: ~3 hours total
- 1 hour: Initial setup, CSV parsing, and QUASAR format handling
- 1 hour: Interactive plotting with dual-axis scaling
- 1 hour: UI polish, channel management, and real data integration

The web framework choice enabled rapid development of complex interactive features that would have taken significantly longer in a desktop framework.

- Duration: 42.5 seconds (12,752 samples at 300 Hz)
- Channels: 24 total (21 EEG + 2 ECG + 1 reference)

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Backend**: Python with Pandas for data processing
- **Frontend**: Dash (React-based) with Plotly for visualization
- **Data Flow**: CSV → Pandas DataFrame → Plotly Graph → Interactive Web UI

### Key Components
```
src/eeg_viewer.py          # Main application (550 lines)
├── EEGViewer class        # Core functionality
├── Data loading           # QUASAR format parsing
├── Interactive plotting   # Dual-axis visualization
└── Web interface         # Dash callbacks and layout
```

### QUASAR-Specific Adaptations
- Metadata parsing from `# Sample_Frequency_(Hz) = 300` headers
- Channel detection for standard EEG electrode names (Fz, Cz, P3, C3, etc.)
- Proper handling of µV units (no conversion needed)
- ECG channel identification (X1:LEOG, X2:REOG)

## Design Choices

### EEG vs ECG Scaling Strategy
The application implements **dual-axis scaling** to handle the different amplitude ranges:

- **EEG Channels (Primary Y-axis)**:
  - Units: µV (microvolts)
  - Typical range: ±100 µV
  - Channels: P3, C3, F3, Fz, F4, C4, P4, Cz, A1, Fp1, Fp2, T3, T5, O1, O2, F7, F8, A2, T6, T4, Pz
  - Rationale: EEG signals are small amplitude brain electrical activity

- **ECG Channels (Secondary Y-axis)**:
  - Units: mV (millivolts) - converted from µV for better readability
  - Typical range: ±3 mV
  - Channels: X1:LEOG, X2:REOG (Left/Right Electrooculogram)
  - Rationale: ECG/EOG signals have much larger amplitude than EEG

### Technology Stack Rationale
- **Web Framework**: Enables cross-platform deployment and modern UI patterns
- **Plotly**: Professional-grade interactive plotting with built-in zoom/pan
- **Dash**: Reactive UI framework for rapid development of data applications
- **Pandas**: Efficient data manipulation and CSV parsing

## Data Format Requirements

The application handles the standard QUASAR format:
```
# Mains_Frequency_(Hz) =,60
# Sample_Frequency_(Hz) =,300
# Sensor_Data_Units =,uV
...
Time,P3,C3,F3,Fz,F4,C4,P4,Cz,CM,A1,Fp1,Fp2,...
0.0000,2.1,-53.9,52.1,12.6,26.4,-40.7,-37.1,...
